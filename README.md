Uber Rides Data Analysis using Python

Uber wants to analyze customer behavior concerning ride distances to optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction. The company has observed that the majority of cab bookings are within 0-20 miles, with a significant concentration between 4-5 miles. However, for distances exceeding 20 miles, the number of cab bookings drops sharply and becomes almost negligible.

Objectives:

1) Data Analysis:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of ride distances and identify patterns or anomalies in customer behavior.
Analyze factors influencing the high demand for rides within the 4-5 mile range.

Investigate the reasons behind the low demand for rides beyond 20 miles.


2) Predictive Modeling:

Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a ride being booked for various distance ranges (e.g., 0-5 miles, 5-10 miles, etc.).

Use the model to identify potential factors (e.g., pricing, time of day, location) that could influence customer decisions to book longer rides.


3) Optimization and Strategy Development:

Based on the analysis and model predictions, suggest strategies to increase ride bookings for distances over 20 miles.
Recommend pricing or promotional strategies to maximize bookings within the 0-20 mile range, particularly focusing on the 4-5 mile segment.


4) Deliverables:

A detailed report of the EDA findings, including visualizations of ride distance distributions.

A trained machine learning model for predicting ride booking likelihoods based on distance.

Strategic recommendations for optimizing ride bookings and improving customer satisfaction based on the analysis.

5) Tools & Techniques:

Python: For data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for building and evaluating predictive models.

Data Visualization: Use of dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for interactive insights.

This problem statement will help Uber understand customer preferences better, leading to data-driven decisions for optimizing their ride-booking service.
